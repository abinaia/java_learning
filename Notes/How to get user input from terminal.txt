How to get user input from terminal?
 Scanner abi = new Scanner(System.in);   //here, Scanner is the class, abi is the object name and new is the keyword used to create an object and Scanner(System.in) is the constructor of the Scanner class which takes input from the user through the terminal.
    int num1 = abi.nextInt();  //this is how we take input from the user through the terminal. nextInt() is a method of the Scanner class which is used to take integer input from the user.

sc.nextLine(); //consume the newline character left by nextInt()
-----> Whenever while getting the user input, first you get the int and then if you want to get the string, you have to use this nextLine command because , the enter button or the new line will be stored as one character in the upcoming string variable

eg:
        **String name = sc.nextLine(); //take input for name**

        **int age = sc.nextInt(); //take input for age**

        **sc.nextLine(); //consume the newline character left by nextInt()**

        **String Address = sc.nextLine(); //take input for address**
