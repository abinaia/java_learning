Use of public and static
1️⃣ public

public is an access modifier.

It determines who can use this method.

Meaning:

public → any class in your program can call this method

Other options:

Modifier	Meaning
private	Only inside the same class
protected	Same package + subclasses
default (no keyword)	Only inside same package

💡 Example:

public class Calculator {
    public static int addNumbers(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}


Another class can now call:

int sum = Calculator.addNumbers(1,2,3);


If it were private, the other class cannot use it.

2️⃣ static

static means this method belongs to the class itself, not an object.

Normally, to call a method, you need an object:

Calculator calc = new Calculator();
int sum = calc.addNumbers(1,2,3); // if method is non-static


But if you declare static, you can call it directly using the class name:

int sum = Calculator.addNumbers(1,2,3);


✅ No object needed
