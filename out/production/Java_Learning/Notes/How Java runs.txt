Java Compiler ->Byte Code -> Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
Byte Code is platform independent
As java is object oriented, everything should be inside a class.
Java is case-sensitive.
Class names usually starts with capital  letters.
public static void main(String args[])   //here public is the access modifier, static is the keyword, void is the return type, main is the method name and String args[] is the parameter
🔹 public

Access modifier

Means this method can be accessed from anywhere

The JVM must be able to access it

🔹 static

Means the method belongs to the class itself

You don’t need to create an object to call it

Without static, Java would require:

hello obj = new hello();
obj.main();


But the JVM runs main() directly — so it must be static.

🔹 main

This is the special method name.

Java runtime always looks for main to start execution.

🔹 What are Command-Line Arguments?

They are values you pass when running the program.

Example:

java hello Abi 123 Colombo


Here:

hello → class name

Abi → first argument

123 → second argument

Colombo → third argument

Inside the program:

args[0] = "Abi"
args[1] = "123"
args[2] = "Colombo"
